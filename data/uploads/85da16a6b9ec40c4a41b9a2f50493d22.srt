00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
By the time you finish watching this video, 8 million cups of coffee will have been drunk

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,500
all over the world.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,000
Coffee has been consumed for at least 1.5 thousand years, and some say its impact is so great

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,059
that it helped fuel the enlightenment, which gave rise to some of the big ideas that underpin

5
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:23,600
the world as we know it.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,940
The main active ingredient of coffee is caffeine, which is considered the most widely consumed

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,700
psychoactive drug on the planet.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,539
So where does coffee come from?

9
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:39,980
And what does it do to us when we drink it?

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:46,859
Coffee comes from the fruit of the coffeeer Arabica plant that originated in Ethiopia.

11
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,180
One story claims a 9th century goat hodocool Caldy saw his goats were more full of energy

12
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:57,020
after eating coffee berries, so he had a bite too.

13
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,220
Historic records suggest the sufis of Yemen roasted the seed of the coffee berry to create

14
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,460
the beverage we recognise today.

15
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,500
In the 15th century, the first coffee houses began to appear across the Ottoman Empire

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,500
before spreading to Europe in the following centuries.

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,379
Coffee houses in Europe became a space for discussing business, politics and new ideas.

18
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:28,379
In the macademic, Yergan Habermas even says without coffee we might not have had the

19
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,379
enlightenment.

20
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:37,539
Philosophers like Kant and Voltaire, who is said to have drunk as many as 72 cups a day,

21
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:42,259
started to question the Catholic Church's interpretation of the world.

22
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:47,219
Instead they looked to science, believing that everything in the universe could be rationally

23
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,219
explained.

24
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:54,219
This so-called age of enlightenment radically changed the world as we knew it.

25
00:01:54,219 --> 00:02:03,219
It led to the overthrow of monarchs, the growth of democracy and numerous scientific discoveries.

26
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:06,299
Coffee also fueled the slave trade.

27
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:12,900
The French used slaves from Africa on plantations in Haiti and by the early 1800s Brazil was

28
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:23,379
producing a third of the world's coffee using African slaves.

29
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:26,780
Did coffee give rise to capitalism too?

30
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,860
Companies started giving away coffee to their workers and eventually let them have coffee

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,180
breaks.

32
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,780
This wasn't an altruistic move.

33
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,060
They were trying to increase worker productivity.

34
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:51,379
This forward to the present and two billion cups of coffee are consumed every day.

35
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:56,740
It's a 90 billion dollars a year industry and more than that it is a fundamental social

36
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,780
part of everyday life for billions of people.

37
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,500
So how does coffee impact the body?

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,340
When caffeine enters your digestive system it's absorbed by the intestine into the bloodstream.

39
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,419
But the effects only start when caffeine hits the nervous system.

40
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:22,539
This happens because caffeine has a chemical structure very similar to that of a substance

41
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:28,819
produced by our own body, a denocene.

42
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:37,460
Caffeine binds to the body's adenosine receptors, which can be found on the surface of nerve cells.

43
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,420
It's like a key opening a lock.

44
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,420
A denocene is known to slow down the sympathetic nervous system.

45
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:51,260
It reduces your heart rate and generates a state of drowsiness and relaxation.

46
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,900
By blocking these receptors caffeine generates the opposite effect.

47
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,420
Your blood pressure for example may increase slightly, especially if you are not used to

48
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,460
drinking coffee often.

49
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,820
The same goes for brain activity.

50
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,260
Caffeine stimulates the brain, suppresses hunger and helps you stay in a state of alertness

51
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,020
so you can concentrate for longer.

52
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:20,300
Caffeine can have a positive impact on your mood, inhibit feelings of fatigue and can

53
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,500
improve physical performance.

54
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,060
So many athletes use it as a supplement.

55
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,939
These effects can last between 15 minutes and two hours.

56
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:32,620
The body removes caffeine five to ten hours after consuming it.

57
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:41,699
The caffeine's residual effects can last even longer.

58
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,579
If you want to optimize caffeine's effects on your body, experts suggest abstaining from

59
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:54,980
caffeine in the afternoon so your cup of coffee the following morning has more impact.

60
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,379
Coffee also requires care when it's drunk.

61
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:02,500
For healthy adults the recommended maximum limit is 400mg of caffeine a day.

62
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,139
That's about 4 or 5 cups of coffee.

63
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:11,779
Exceeding this limit can lead to side effects such as insomnia, nervousness, anxiety,

64
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:18,219
tachycardia, stomach discomfort, nausea and headache.

65
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:23,819
Toxic effects like seizures can be seen after the rapid consumption of around 1200mg of

66
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:24,819
caffeine.

67
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:29,860
That's the equivalent of around 12 cups of coffee.

68
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,939
Of course these limits vary from person to person.

69
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:36,740
Some people are genetically more sensitive to caffeine.

70
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,579
But when drunk in moderation, coffee can be good for your health.

71
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:46,779
For instance it's associated with a reduced risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular

72
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:51,139
disease, some cancers and Parkinson's.

73
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,060
And these health gains aren't just linked to caffeine.

74
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,139
Coffee has other beneficial substances such as chlorogenic acids, a potent antioxidant

75
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,139
that may reduce the risk of many diseases.

76
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:06,019
So next time you grab a cup of coffee you might not look at it the same again.
